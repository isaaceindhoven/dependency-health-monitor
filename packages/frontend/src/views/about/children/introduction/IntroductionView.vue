  <h1>Dependency Health Monitor</h1>
  <p>
    The Dependency Health Monitor is an application that is capable of determining the financial health of your
    dependencies in an equitable manner. To determine the financial health, several criteria have been set up. We
    believe these criteria are capable of describing the financial health of a project. To find out what criteria are
    used and how the equity of the financial health is determined, check the links below!
